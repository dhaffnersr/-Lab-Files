# -Lab-Files
This is the start of a major spectroscopy absorption and emission data base. 
These will be all of my lab files from my spectrometer prototype builds on hackaday.com
They will contain all raw csv data files starting from December of 2016 to present day.
All spectral captures and data are processed using Spectragryph 1.0.7 (formally known as Spekwin32.)
